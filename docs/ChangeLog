2008-06-16  Rocco Carbone <rocco /at/ ntop /dot/ org>
	* After a brief talk at ntop lab with Luca and other ntop-ers
	  about the availability of a ntop's CLI (again), I started
	  'pksh' development using sources from the my old unfinished
	  and very very unstable project 'nsh'

2008-07-04  Rocco Carbone <rocco /at/ ntop /dot/ org>
	* Initial public release 0.1.0 announced to ntop mailing list and freshmeat.net

	  FEATURES:
	  * Runs under Linux 2.6.18
	  * Uses libpcap 0.9.8
	  * Uses tcsh 6.15.00
	  * Supports only Ethernet and Loopback data-link network interfaces
	  * Implements the following commands as extensions to native tcsh built-ins
	    o bytes    o packets  o pkhelp o pkdev   o pkopen o pkclose o pkfilter o pkenable
	    o pkuptime o pkstatus o pkswap o pkhosts o pkarp  o pklast  o pkwho    o pkfinger
	    o throughput
	* Most commands have hostname completion and globbing via the $hosts variable
	  e.g. you can issue commands in 'pksh' such as:
               pksh@eth0> pkarp 192.168.TAB
	       pksh@eth0> pkarp 192.168.*
	* General and minimal documentation have been written
	* Set a bare html download area at http://pksh.tecsiel.it [82.187.228.118]
	
2008-07-05  Rocco Carbone <rocco /at/ ntop /dot/ org>
	* fixed core in pkenable.c due to unitialized variable filter
	* fixed core in wrapper.c due to access to the unitialized variable $hosts via adrof()
	* changed the output of pkarp() to include interface name and data-link type
	* changed the output of pkstatus() to include an internet standalone line (network/netmask/broadcast)
	* the HW address => IP address binding has been completely rewritten
