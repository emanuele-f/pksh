  To implement most of the planned functionalities I keep in memory
  several hash tables

  o the hwnames with unique identifiers at the network interface layer
  o the ipnames with unique IP address at the IP protocol layer
  o the l7names with unique hostnames resolved for humans

  All of them reference an unique object in memory.

  Each time an unknown host is viewed an object is allocated to keep
  all relevant information.

  The hashing is heavily based on:

  "Simple hash table implementation"
  "Simple doubly-linked list implementation"

   by Michael W. Shaffer <mwshaffer@yahoo.com>

   with few modification/enhancements by me, Rocco Carbone <rocco /at/ ntop /dot/ org>

   I also planned to use the native hashing algorithms of the tcsh, but currently I had no time
   to take a look at them.


Local convention

  Null IP address "0.0.0.0" is not added to the space of know names
  IP address "255.255.255.255" is not added to the space of know names

  Moreover the IP broadcast and Multicast addresses are not added to the space of know names



  How both the hwnames and the ipnames refer to the same element in memory.


              HW hash table
          +-------------------+
      key | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx |
          |-------------------|
      val |     reference     |---*    host
          +-------------------+   |  +------+
                                  +->|      |
             IP hash table           |      |
          +-------------------+   +->|      |
      key |  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  |   |  +------+
          |-------------------|   |
      val |     reference     |---+
          +-------------------+
