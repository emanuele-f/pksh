Subject: ANNOUNCE - 'pksh', the Packet Shell
Date: Sat, 5 Jul 2008 00:00:40 +0200

   Hi all,
this is to announce the first release of 'pksh', the Packet Shell, that
is a hack of the popular 'tcsh' for packets, bytes, hosts and protocols
counts mainly implemented to include passive network monitoring
functionalities into a shell.

So 'pksh' is a shell.  No, no!  'pksh' is a pcap-based network sniffer,
like 'tcpdump' and 'ntop'.  No, no again!  'pksh' is both a shell, a
network sniffer, a query language for network monitoring and finally
a rendering engine to display in a form readable for humans and
system administrators all traffic on LAN segments.

It aims to give on character-based terminals the same level of
information 'ntop' already provides via its embedded web interface.

Contrary to most text-based sniffers, 'pksh' does not continuosly fill
the terminal with packets/bytes/protocols information, but it allows the
user to perform his daily job at the shell level and take a look
at network only via a set of commands implemented as extensions to
native tcsh's built-ins.

Morevover the output 'pksh' provides can be filtered/sorted/paged/mailed/othered
using all native Unix commands available at the shell level.

Luca and me agreed to host the project on 'ntop' web server, and to be
quickly integrated into family of ntop's technologies and products,
but he is so busy these days and his support is quite limited.

Therefore the first release will have minimal web/mailing lists support.

I set just a temporary download area at:

  http://pksh.tecsiel.it
  http://82.187.228.118

where you can find further information and the source code, obviously
released under GLPv3, in a tar-gzipped distribution file named
pksh-0.1.0.tar.gz

I need your feedback to understand the need of the community for such tool
in order to continue the effort to add support for more network interfaces,
more protocols, more built-ins, more data rendering, more of other.

Enjoy

/rocco
