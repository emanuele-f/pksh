'pksh' is a hack of the popular 'tcsh' for packets, bytes hosts and protocols counts.  So 'pksh' is a shell.  No, no!  'pksh' is a pcap-based network sniffer, like 'tcpdump' and 'ntop'.  No, no again!  'pksh' is both a shell, a network sniffer, a query language for network monitoring and finally a rendering engine to display in a form readable for humans and network administrators all traffic on LAN segments.  It aims to give on character-based terminals the same level of information 'ntop' already provides via its embedded web interface.  Contrary to most text-based sniffers, 'pksh' does not continuosly fill the terminal with packets/bytes/protocols information, but it allows the user to perform his daily job at the shell level and take a look at network only via a set of commands implemented as extensions to native tcsh's built-ins.  Morevover the output 'pksh' provides can be filtered/sorted/paged/mailed/othered
using all native Unix commands available at the shell level.
