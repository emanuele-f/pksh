F A Q:
======

Q. Why did you implemented 'pksh'?
A. Because I want to learn more of network protocols
   from the programmer point of view.


Q. What can 'pksh' do for me?
A. 'pksh' is a pcap-based network sniffer like the so popular
   'tcpdump', 'trafshow' and 'ipgraf', but it does not continuosly
   fill the terminal with lot of information at the system speed,
   but only on user demand via command line interactions.


Q. Why I should use this software?
A. If you are interestered in advanced network monitoring give
   'pksh' a chance to run on your LAN segment.  It aims to be
   in a near future a modern solution for network problem monitoring
   using only character-based terminals.


Q. Why does 'pksh' use a dedicated thread to sniff packets on each interface?
A. This is a long story.  This is only a temporary solution because I had
   no much time to hack tcsh's input read-loop routine.  So I had really
   no alternatives in the short time.
   But I will implement the single-process version as soon as possible.


Q. Can I know the list of OSs and supported platforms 'pksh' run on?
A. 'pksh' was written and tested on an Intel i686 box running
    Debian/Linux (the glorious tar.tecsiel.it) with the
    GNU C compiler; then the software was ported on the another
    main target development host I have access to, running
    the Solaris 10 Operating System.
